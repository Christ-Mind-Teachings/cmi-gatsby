**“I am not a body. I am free.<br/>
For I am still as God created me.”**
</div>

“I want the peace of God.”

<div markdown="1" class="review center">

The peace of God is everything I want.<br/>
The peace of God is my one goal; the aim<br/>
of all my living here, the end I seek,<br/>
my purpose and my function and my life<br/>
while I abide where I am not at home.
</div>
