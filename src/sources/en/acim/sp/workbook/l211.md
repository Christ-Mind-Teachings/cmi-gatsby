<div markdown="1" class="center">

**“I am not a body. I am free.<br/>
For I am still as God created me.”**
</div>

“I am the holy Son of God Himself.”

<div markdown="1" class="review center">

In silence and in true humility<br/>
I seek God’s glory, to behold it in<br/>
the Son whom He created as my Self.
</div>
