<span class="dropcaps">N</span>ow is the<br/>
end come.<br/>
We are returned<br/>
to the ancient<br/>
beginning.
{: .top}


Here,<br/>
where Truth is restored,<br/>
we look with gentleness<br/>
upon the world.

<span class="dropcaps">Y</span>ou are here only to be<br/>
truly helpful.<br/>
Yet<br/>
you do not know<br/>
what needs to be done.
{: .top}

Would you know<br/>
your Father's will for you?

Precious friend,<br/>
open the eyes of your Self;<br/>
it will not be hidden<br/>
from you.

<span class="dropcaps">W</span>here does the
servant go,<br/> awakened to the eternal?<br/> "Here,"<br/> comes the
quiet reply.

<span class="dropcaps">B</span>ecause *you*<br/>
are awake *here*<br/>
and your sister<br/>
is awake *here*,<br/>
though bodies are<br/>
seemingly separate,<br/>
there is not two,<br/>
but one.

<span class="dropcaps">P</span>ray<br/>
fast,<br/>
meditate.<br/>
Journey into the silent places<br/>
of your precious Earth,<br/>
for she alone is your mother.
{: .top}

Sing,<br/>
laugh,<br/>
dance,<br/>
play.

Drink the first rays of a new dawn.<br/>
Touch the dark velvet<br/>
of a moonless night.<br/>
Feel the grasses against your skin,<br/>
and stand beneath<br/>
the cascading waterfall.

Give but one day of your week<br/>
to silence,<br/>
eating only the Light<br/>
from your Father.

---

<span class="dropcaps">S</span>mile often,<br/>
and remember<br/>
you have chosen to come,<br/>
*here*.<br/>
Look around you,<br/>
and bless the place you are.<br/>
Do these things often,<br/>
in remembrance of me.
